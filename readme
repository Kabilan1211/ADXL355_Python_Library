This is a python library to integrate ADXL355B MEMS based accelerometer sensor with raspberry pi boards. This code is developed with the help of the arduino ADXL355B library.

Step 1 : Run the following command in the terminal.

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade -y

    sudo raspi-config

    Then Navigate to Interface options > SPI and select Enable.

    sudo reboot

    sudo apt install python3-pip -y
    pip3 install spidev

Step 2 : Connect the circuit diagram as per the connections mentioned below.

ADXL355 pin     -     Raspberry Pi Pin     -     Pin Function
VCC             -     Pin 1 (3.3V)         -     Power 
GND             -     Pin 6 (GND)          -     Ground
SCLK            -     Pin 23 (GPIO11)      -     SPI Clock
MISO            -     Pin 21 (GPIO9)       -     SPI Master-In Slave-Out
MOSI            -     Pin 19 (GPIO10)      -     SPI Master-Out Slave-In
CS              -     Pin 24 (GPIO8)       -     Chip Select (SPI0_CS0)

Step 3 : Download this code and extract the rar file.
Step 4 : Create the library file named adxl355.py using the following command.

    nano adxl355.py

Step 5 : Then paste the ADXL355.py code in the downloaded folder and paste it in the newly created library file named adxl355.py.
Step 6 : Now open the example folder in the downloaded folder and open the getData.py file.
Step 7 : Update the path imported in the file.
Step 8 : Execute it to get the temperature and axes data.
